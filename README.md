# discord-howgay-command
This command shows you how GAY you are.

This command is just a fun command to have, so to anyone who is LGBTQIA+, this is not meant to be offensive to you. 

I am providing this code in v12 and v13 which will be helpful for majority of people out there! 

I have put credits in the Description, and i would like you to keep it there, as i made this command and providing it to you as well. Thanks, and hope you enjoy!

usage: `(prefix)howgay @mentionUser`
